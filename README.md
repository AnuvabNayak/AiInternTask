# Object Detection Model using Detectron2 and Mask R-CNN
This repository contains an object detection model built using Python, Detectron2, and Mask R-CNN. The model is designed to perform object detection and instance segmentation, enabling it to identify and classify objects in an image while generating a segmentation mask for each detected object.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project implements an object detection model using Detectron2, a Facebook AI Research library, and Mask R-CNN, a popular deep-learning model for object detection and instance segmentation. The model was developed and trained on Google Colab, leveraging its GPU resources.

<h2>Features</h2>
Object Detection: The model detects multiple objects in an image and draws bounding boxes around them.
Instance Segmentation: Along with object detection, the model generates a segmentation mask for each detected object.
Customizable: You can train the model on any custom dataset.
Pre-trained Models: Utilize pre-trained models for faster training and better performance.
