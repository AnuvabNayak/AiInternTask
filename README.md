# Object Detection Model using Detectron2 and Mask R-CNN
This repository contains an object detection model built using Python, Detectron2, and Mask R-CNN. The model is designed to perform object detection and instance segmentation, enabling it to identify and classify objects in an image while generating a segmentation mask for each detected object.
